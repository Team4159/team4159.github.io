Retailers like REV and CTRE are indispensable for their [made-for-FRC electronics](/main/electronics/frc_electronics), but there are often significantly cheaper generic alternatives to their individually sold data cables and connectors. 

## Ribbon Data Cable

Custom length wires can be made using the Digi-Key supplies by using a vice grip to crimp the connectors on.

## JST to PWM

To use the REV magnetic limit switches with the RoboRIO's PWM DIO ports, you can use REV's connectors or just cut off one end of the JST cable, and solder the respective wires onto a PWM cable, as the blue and red wires are interchangeable.
