Modelling your control system can help give you <i>theoretical</i> numbers for the system.

A good Spartan Series workshop covering getting data for motors and basic modelling: [Control Systems Modelling](https://youtu.be/RLrZzSpHP4E).

Based a [presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2_uZiqVGy5kVTJIbm5QSms4WUNFRjdNcENRU3BzUF8xMnlF/view) from an alumni on selecting gear ratios, in the 2019 offseason, we made a simple [Google Sheets calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pMm6WNGCRJzyjE1hbUZBTIkgNYC_FDqkWydOC56BCa4/edit#gid=0) for finding the optimal drivetrain gear ratios for different motors over a given distance, which can easily be adapted for other common mechanisms and goals.
