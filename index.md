This site includes FRC Team 4159 CardinalBotics' project documentation, references, and blog on FRC software, controls, and electronics.

Our mission is to preserve and pass down knowledge to future generation of CardinalBots. Most of the content will be references to other people/team's works, instead of writing out all these tutorials ourselves.

Also, there'll probably be an interactive knowledge map on this homepage for viewing pleasure. This website is still under construction.
