[insert knowledge map here]

This site includes FRC Team 4159 CardinalBotics' project documentation, references, and blog on FRC software, controls, and electronics.

Our mission is to preserve and pass down knowledge to future generation of CardinalBots. Most of the content will be references to other people/team's works, to save time and repetition if writing all these tutorials ourselves.

This website is still under construction.
