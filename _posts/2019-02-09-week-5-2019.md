### Highlights of the week:

- We almost finished wiring our pneumatics system. The compressor, pressure relief valve, pressure switch, stored pressure gauge, and 6 solenoid manifold are all mounted.

- Silvan helped us test the cargo intake system. We diagnosed leaks and the control code.

- Four air tanks will be mounted using 3D printed mounts.

- With the help of Edmond, a returning programming mentor, we finally got OpenCV up and running on the Jetson.

- We tested powering the Jetson through the VRM

### Upcoming:

- Clean up wiring and tubing

- Continue testing mechanisms as the mechanical team assembles them on the robot

- Test communications between the RoboRio and the Jetson

- Work on implementing auto aligning algorithms based on image recognition
