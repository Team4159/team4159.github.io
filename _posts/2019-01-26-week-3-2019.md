### Robot Software

- We received a more final design consensus from the design team.
- Almost all subsystem and command classes have been created to allow for driver control. This includes: Drivetrain, Elevator, Feeder, Grabber, CargoExtender, and Hatch.
- This upcoming week we hope to test our code on an assembled drivetrain.

### Image Recognition

- We have made significant progress in testing IR light instead of green visible light reflecting off the retroreflective tape.
- We are using a camera [IR filter](https://www.amazon.com/NEEWER-58MM-Infrared-Filter-Camera/dp/B003U65A7E/) lens in front of a [PlayStation Eye](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-PlayStation-Camera-Bulk-Packaging-Pc/dp/B0072I2240) camera, which we chose for its cost and higher IR sensitivity than most cameras

- Using generated code from GRIP and employing vision techniques, we were able to detect whether two pieces of tape were to be grouped together or not, drawing a bounding box around them.
- Our next steps are to test edge cases where more than 2 tape are visible and when the camera is at an angle from the tape
