### Highlights of this week:

- We wired the elevator using igus energy chain and coiled pneumatic tubing.

- We moved driver camera streaming from the Jetson to the roboRIO side. We're using WPILib's built in camera server and this solved our lag problem to an acceptable range. A joystick button is set to switch between the front and back camera streams.

- We tested all subsystems of the robot. We set current limits to the elevator to prevent stalling but it is yet to be tested.

### Upcoming post build season:

- Test roboRIO and Jetson communicatio n
- Test auto aligning and path following for autonomous
