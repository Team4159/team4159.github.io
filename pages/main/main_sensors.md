## Preface

Without sensors and feedback that utilizes them, your robot is basically an overengineered RC car.

*Seriously, in a demo event I remember one parent asked, "What makes this a robot and not just a RC car?" It was difficult to answer that question.*

Let's take a look at the sensors we use in our FRC robots.

## Sensors

### 1. Encoders and Potentiometers

### 3. Gyroscopes and IMUs

### 4. Limit Switches

### 5. Other Not So Common Ones But Maybe Useful

## Programming Sensors

## Further Learning

1678 has done multiple workshops on "RoboRio and Sensors". You should watch one of these videos to supplement our notes above.
