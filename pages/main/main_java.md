WPILib officially supports Java, C++, and LabView to program FRC robots. We use Java because it is more accessible to beginner programmers, taught by our AP Computer Science class, and isn't a visual based language like LabView.

MIT Course 6.092, "Introduction to Programming in Java", offered online for free on MIT OpenCourseware is a great way to learn Java. The online course includes lecture notes and appropriate assignments. We recommend going through all lectures (1 - 7). The later lectures (4 - 7), overlap with our OOP section, so you may go through those in conjunction.

You will learn about data types, conditionals, loops, arrays, OOP principles, good practices, and more. Some of the topics won't be as relevant in FRC programming, but they're good to know anyways.

If you have already gone through AP Computer Science at Lowell, this course may serve as a refresher.
